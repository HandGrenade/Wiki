[H="Drawing the Winner"] [B][COLOR=#0059b3]Drawing the Winner of the Jackpot[/COLOR][/B] [/H]

[B][COLOR=#0059b3]NOTE: [/COLOR][/B]For a jackpot to start, [COLOR=#0059b3]2 players[/COLOR] must enter one of the jackpots. Once at least 2 players have entered, the jackpot will be decided in [COLOR=#0059b3]60 seconds[/COLOR].

Before the jackpot draws, you can check the amount up for grabs by hovering over the jackpot you entered. This will also give you a percentage chance of winning and the number of people that have entered. In this example, I entered $100 meaning my chances of winning are very small.
