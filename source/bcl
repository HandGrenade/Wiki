[FONT=Trebuchet MS]BetterChunkLoader (developed by KaiNoMood) is a plugin that adds its own customisable chunk loaders that replaces the various other chunk loaders in the Tekkit Legend and FTB: Infinity Evolved modpacks.

This plugin features two types of chunk loaders:[/FONT]
[INDENT][FONT=Trebuchet MS]- Online only Chunk loaders (represented as an Iron block), which only load chunks while to chunk loader owner is online.
- Offline Chunk loaders (represented as a Diamond block), which load chunks when the chunk loader owner is offline as well as online.[/FONT][/INDENT]

Chunk loaders in this plugin can be edited to have different dimensions. There are 5 dimensions available for chunk loaders currently:[/FONT]
[INDENT][FONT=Trebuchet MS]- 1x1 (1 chunks^2 area)
- 3x3 (9 chunks^2 area)
- 5x5 (25 chunks^2 area)
- 7x7 (49 chunks^2 area)
- 9x9 (81 chunks^2 area)[/FONT][/INDENT]

Below is a table showing how many chunk loaders each donation rank gets. Non-donators get a max of 6 chunk loaders. Players can also buy chunk loaders as a separate item from the donation shop.

1) Place down the block for whatever type of chunk loader you want, either an iron block for an online only chunk loader, or a diamond block for an offline chunk loader. Keep in mind, the offline chunk loader is only accessible to some donator ranks.[/FONT]

2) With your blaze rod in hand, right click on the iron/diamond block to bring up its GUI. You must do this almost immediately after placing the chunk loader block, otherwise the block will have to be broken and placed again. The following menu should open up:
