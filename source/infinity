Toasty Networks has a FTB:Infinity Evolved Server, a modpack that contains 178 mods. This allows our community to have a large selection of mods to choose from! However, joining the FTB: IE server is not the same as joining our Tekkit Legends server.
To play on the ToastyNetworks FTB: Infinity Evolved server, the Feed The Beast launcher must first be installed. There are two ways of doing this:

[H="method one"][COLOR=#00b3b3][B]By downloading Curse:[/B][/COLOR][/H][/FONT][SPOILER="Curse Tutorial"]
[FONT=Trebuchet MS]1) Visit this website [URL='https://www.feed-the-beast.com']here[/URL] and click the big, red download button in the middle of your screen:

2) Once you have downloaded Curse and set it up, you will be taken to a screen where you are asked to log in/register. If you do not have an account, click "create an account", underneath the login button. Once you have done this, sign in:

3) Once you have signed in, you will be taken to the main screen of the curse. On the side of the window is a  bar with icons. Click the last one with the creeper face:

5) Once you click "Browse FTB Modpacks", the following screen should pop up. From here, either look for "FTB: Infinity Evolved" on the modpack list, or search it in the search bar. Do NOT confuse "Infinity evolved" for "Infinity Evolved Skyblock", these are two different packs. To join the server, you need "Infinity Evolved". Once you find the pack, hover over the modpack icon and click the install button:

6) Once "FTB: Infinity Evolved" finishes installing, you can go to your side bar and click the creeper face icon (like in step 3). The difference is, this time, you will find that there will be a button there for you to click to play the modpack. Click play:

7) Once you click play, the launcher will open up. From here, click play, making sure your profile is set to "FTB Infinity Evolved":

8) After FTB finishes loading, you should be taken to the main screen. Click multiplayer and add the Toasty Networks server like you would normally. The IP is [B]ftb.toastynetworks.net:[/B][/FONT]
