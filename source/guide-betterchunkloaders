[FONT=Trebuchet MS][SIZE=7][B]Types Of Chunk Loaders.[/B][/SIZE][/FONT]
[FONT=Arial]This plugin allows for two kinds of chunk loaders to be used. They are as follows:[/FONT]
[LIST]
[*][FONT=Arial][B][COLOR=#ff0000]Online Only[/COLOR] [/B]- This will only load chunks while the owner of the chunk loader is online. [B](Represented as an Iron Block)[/B][/FONT]
[*][FONT=Arial][B][COLOR=#ff0000]Always Online[/COLOR] [/B]- This will load chunks at all times, regardless of whether the owner is online. [B](Represented as a Diamond Block)[/B][/FONT]
[/LIST]
[FONT=Arial]All players start off with 6 [I]Online Only[/I] chunk loaders at their disposal. However, you must purchase [I]Always Online[/I] chunk loaders or obtain them with the [I]Lazarus[/I] rank. In order to use the [I]Always Online[/I] chunk loaders you must also have the permission for it. This can be bought with the chunk loaders or with the [I]Lazarus[/I] rank.[/FONT]


[FONT=Trebuchet MS][SIZE=7][B]Setup of Chunk Loaders.[/B][/SIZE][/FONT]
[LIST=1]
[*][FONT=Arial]Place down the block which represents which type of chunk loader you want to use [B](Online Only = Iron Block; Always Online = Diamond Block)[/B]. Keep in mind, the [I]Always Online[/I] chunk loader requires a specific permission to be used.
[/FONT]
[*][FONT=Arial]With a Blaze Rod in your hand, right click on the Iron/Diamond Block to bring up the BetterChunkLoader GUI. This must be done almost immediately after placing down the block, otherwise you will need to break and replace the block.
[/FONT]
[*][FONT=Arial]Select the dimensions for your chunk loader (See below for dimensions information). This is done by clicking one of the icons in the menu. If completed correctly, you should receive a message saying that your chunk loader has been created.[/FONT]
